## Assignment
Assignment : 1 - In this assignment i will leverage the knowledge gained in Module 01 to develop classes to support a larger system. This is the first of many assignments in this course, each of which will build on the previous assignment in order to produce a complete system. The focus of this assignment aligns with the focus of the first module - that is, classes, encapsulation and unit test planning.
